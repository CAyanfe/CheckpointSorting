This repository contains all task assigned for Insertion sort algorithm programing

Started with the second element in the array (index 1), considering it as the current element to be inserted into the sorted subarray.
Compare the current element with the elements in the sorted subarray (from index 0 to i-1), moving elements greater than the current element one position to the right.
Insert the current element into its correct position in the sorted subarray.
Repeat steps 1-3 until all elements in the array are part of the sorted subarray.
